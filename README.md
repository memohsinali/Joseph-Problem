# Joseph-Problem

History: This problem is named after Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian living in
the 1st century. According to Josephus' account of the siege of Yodfat, he and his 40
soldiers were trapped in a cave by Roman soldiers. They chose suicide over capture, and settled on a serial method of committing suicide by drawing lots. Josephus states
that by luck or possibly by the hand of God, he and another man remained until the
end and surrendered to the Romans rather than killing themselves. This is the story
given in Book 3, Chapter 8, part 7 of Josephus' The Jewish War (writing of himself in
the third person)
In computer science and mathematics, the Josephus problem (or Josephus
permutation) is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem
1. People (any number N >1) are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. 2. Counting begins at a specified point (S selected randomly) in the circle and
proceeds around the circle in a specified direction. You can assume that it is
clockwise.

3. After a specified number of people are skipped, say (k-1), the next (kth) person
is executed. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the
next person, going in the same direction and skipping the same number of people
(k-1), until only one person remains, and is freed. Write a C++ program that solves the Josephus problem by using a Queue data
structure. Your program should take N and K input from the user. Design a graphical  user interface that will update with every move as shown in figure above.
